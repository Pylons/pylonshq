About the Pylons framework
==========================

Pylons 1.0 is a lightweight web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid
development.

Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl,
providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It's also
one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, which
allows extensive re-use and flexibility â€” but only if you need it. Out of the
box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy.

Maintenance-only mode
---------------------

The Pylons web framework has merged with repoze.bfg into `Pyramid
<https://trypyramid.com/>`_, and is now in maintenance-only mode. You may
submit a `pull request <https://github.com/Pylons/pylons/pulls>`_ or `issue
<https://github.com/Pylons/pylons/issues>`_, then respectfully request of the
maintainers to accept it and make a release.

It's highly recommended that new projects start with the new merged web
framework, `Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_.
